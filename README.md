# SmartCrop-Agricultural-Crop-Recommendation-System

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection. 
By inputting essential environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system predicts the optimal crop for cultivation. 
Leveraging a trained model, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, the system calculates Mean Squared Errors to evaluate model performance. 
The user-friendly web interface allows farmers to receive crop recommendations based on their inputs, with results displayed alongside a visual representation of model performance. 
This innovative tool streamlines decision-making for sustainable and productive crop cultivation.
